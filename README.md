# Baseband

Baseband is a threat-assessment application that prioritizes one key element: ease of use. Our goal
was to create an application that provides key security-enhancing functionality, presented in an
interface that's navigable by the average user.

Our threat assessment works by evaluating a userâ€™s computer in several important areas, providing
them with tips and information in how to improve their rating, and finally giving them a final score,
evaluating their overall system security.
